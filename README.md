# 🎶 Terminal Lyric Visualizer - Pamungkas "To The Bone"

A terminal-based lyric visualizer built with Python 🐍  
This project displays the lyrics of Pamungkas’ *"To The Bone"* in real time using threading and time delays, simulating a karaoke-style lyric flow inside your terminal.

---

## ✨ Features

- Clean and animated lyric display
- Uses Python’s `time.sleep()` and `threading.Thread` for timing
- Matches the rhythm of the actual song
- Fun to customize with your favorite lyrics

---

## 🎧 How It Works

This script prints each line of the lyrics with a delayed effect, similar to how subtitles or karaoke lines appear.  
It doesn’t play music directly, so you can **manually play the song** from Spotify/YouTube while the script runs for a synced experience.

- Python 3
- `time`, `threading`, `sys` modules
